What knowledge and/or skills did you learn?
    - Aspects of the language?
        + I learned how to use hooks and how to update data for the users to see, live.
    
    - Specific topics?
        + I learned how to fetch data from the backend server, responses, async and await, and more.
    
    - Specific java classes?
        + I used i18n for translation, Axios for fetching, as well as the built-in fetch function
        inside javascript, and some other web design frameworks like bootstrap and fontawesome. 
    
    - Project management?
        + Just realized (more) about how important it is to use git.
    
    - Time management?
        + I had multiple other culminating projects, and managing time was difficult, but I always put at least
        one hour aside for ICS.

What problems did you experience? 
    + Lots of problems. Like fetching data from the server and then immediately 
    updating the DOM with new data. Logging users in was also a pain but managed to make it work.
    
    - How did you overcome them?
        + Just by persisting, researching, watching, and doing. Mostly from StackOverflow,
        YouTube tutorials, and other resources.
    
    - Show your learning that isnâ€™t explicitly shown through the code?
        + Online docs, and YouTube videos. For example, Dennis Ivy on YT has helped me a lot with react.
        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZRcDjjkVajGL6wd76UnGg and he helped me set up the log-in system.
        As well as https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja who helped me a lot at the beginning when I had no idea how react worked.
