                man i wish i could travel in time. maybe i don't idk cuz it sounds insane and kinda scary. this is getting cringe
                so imma wrap it up quick. hope everything is well and hope ur happy. never lose hope :)
            </h3>
            <h2>It's 10:21 2022-07-10 kinda unusual as I write these in the midnight usually. lol yeah i got into York. 
                Well i got an offer, they haven't actually accepted my offer yet, but yeah. I guess we'regoing h4 to h3 to h2 ...
                anyways I finished building the react version of the site some time ago, and now I'm deleting everything else that 
                I built with django. well it's all on github so no worries, but honesly it does hurt me a little bit lmao. like 
                just deleting everything... but it's all still there just in a different lang. anyways idk when imma do another one of these
                it seems like everytime I wrote more, and also every rouggghhly (spelling is hard) 6-7 months i write to my future self.
                Grade 12 is over and it was damn boring and hard. Didn't put all of my effort into it. for reasons i still don't clearly know.
                I guess it's just cuz I'm lazy, and at the time (still at this time too) I didn't see the future in studiying. like studiying
                hard at least. I feel like following my dreams, and actually being out in the world is a better opportunity to grow than 
                anything else. but hey i might change, and be like wow i was so dumb. I wish i studied more so I could get in uNiVeRiSty OOOOF
                ToRoNTo. like bruh fuck that. anyways this got long, hope you're happy future me. if ur not then be happy. btw did u get a gf:)
